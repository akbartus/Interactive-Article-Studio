# Interactive-3D-Story-Creator

### Some tasks to be addressed next:
- Add options for scrolling text like font color, size.
- Explore NYT R&D ThreeBird in house scrolytelling app based on images provided (it is not open-source but can give some ideas about the features I can integrate further) 
- Implement ability to load/import a spreadsheet containing text, frame number, and duration for how long the scrollable text remains visible in frames. This feature will help save time rather than writing/pasting in the editor. Journalists will be able to load their text instantly.
- Add possibility of loading custom path for camera. Still need to test its fit, but to have this feature would be an added value.
- Add possibility to make change of slides based on click event (clicking on a button - left/right - makes camera jump from point A to point B).
- Add Help menu item explaining how to's. 
- Create tutorials on creating Gaussian Splat and GTLF files.
- Think about adding blog section?
- Improve UI and start working on mobile version.
- Add improved code exporting feature.
- Add multiple language support (preferably German, French and Spanish).
- Talk to VisCom school, Ohio Today magazine and Barbara Geralds Institute for Storytelling and Social Impact to get their ideas and features they are interested in.  
- Replace png icons with svg icons and add cdn url addresses so that scrolytelling exported remains standalone.
- Add favicon/logo for the project.
- Add server side code for storing and file management.
